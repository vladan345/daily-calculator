## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See the size of the elements adjust based on their device's screen size
- Perform mathmatical operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
- Adjust the color theme based on their preference
- **Bonus**: Have their initial theme preference checked using `prefers-color-scheme` and have any additional changes saved in the browser

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Javascript

### What I learned

The main thing I learned from this project is the global eval() function in javascript that takes a string as a parameter,
makes calculation and return the value also as a string. This function saved me from lots of writing.
Also, theme changer was new to me but it was pretty fun.

### Continued development

This project was more of a recap of basic javascript and DOM manipulation for me, but that theme changer solution doesn't look very efficient for me so I would definitely try to change that and maybe add that bonus "saving user theme preference" functionality.
